HTML (HyperText Markup Language) is used to define our page content,
structure and meaning. You don't use it for styling
purposes. Use CSS for that instead!


HTML uses "elements" to describe (annotate) content


HTML elements typically have an opening tag, content and then a
closing tag


You can also have void (empty) elements like images


You can also configure elements with attributes


There's a long list of available elements but you'll gain experience
over time, no worries.


Learn more about all available HTML elements on <a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Element"
>the MDN HTML element reference</a>.


CSS Summary

CSS (Cascading Style Sheets) is usedfor styling your page content.


Styles are assigned via property-value pairs


You can assign styles via the "style" attribute


To avoid code duplication, you typically use global styles (e.g. via
the "style" element) instead

Alternatively, you can work with external stylesheet files which you
"link" to


When working with CSS, concepts like "inheritance", "specificity"
and the "box model" should be understood.
